This blog was a piece of cake to setup, thanks to [Github](http://github.com)
and Tom's [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/).

Github allows each user account and each public git repository to have it's own
static site using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). Secondly, Jekyll
processes static (though templated) html files in a way that makes it easy
to maintain a blog or other collection of similarly formatted pages.

How To
------

1. Fork [this
   repository](https://github.com/danielbeardsley/danielbeardsley.github.com)
1. Rename it to `yourusername.github.com` or create a new branch called
   `gh-pages`
1. Delete content in `_posts/`
1. Change all references in `atom.xml` to your own
1. Change all references in `index.html` to your own
1. Push to github
1. Restyle as you wish by editing the css files.
