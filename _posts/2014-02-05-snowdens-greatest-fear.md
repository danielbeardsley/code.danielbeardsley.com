title: "Edward Snowden's greatest fear already happened in the 1970's"
summary: Edward Snowden has stated that his biggest fear after revealing the large
         scale domenstic spying operations of the NSA is that nothing would come
         of it. Sadly, it looks like this already happened in the 1970's.

This [article by Mark Ames] explains the history much more thoroughly, I highly
recommend reading it.

In the late 60s through the early 70s a congressional committee led by [Otis G.
Pike] investigated the FBI, CIA, and NSA. The committee spent years
interviewing, issuing court subpoenas, asking hard questions about the dealings,
efficacy, and legitimacy of these organizations. Their findings were very similar
to what we see the NSA doing today: unconstitutional bulk data collection
without warrants, lots of waste, no proof of efficacy, no oversight, ...
The report was eventually blocked from public release by the [Ford
Administration] but parts of it were leaked to the press in spite.

The sad thing is that these findings (and other bad political news of the time)
drove the public away from politics in general. The agencies (and the
government) spun the committee and it's report in the most negative way they
could, causing the public to sigh, move on and wonder if any of it was true.

Edward Snowden has mentioned that his biggest fear in releasing the classified
documents is that nothing would happen. This is still very possible as *nothing*
happened the last time information like this was brought to light.
