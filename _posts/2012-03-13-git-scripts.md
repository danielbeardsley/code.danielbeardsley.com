iFixit open-sourced their git workflow scripts: [git-scripts][gitscripts]

Working at iFixit is great.  I've been a big fan of open-source software for a
while and it's something we use heavily at iFixit.  We've recently switched to
using Git and in the process adopted a workflow similar to [Git flow][gitflow].

To support this workflow and to enforce a little more consistency we've created
a set of ruby scripts for managing feature-branches and hotfix-branches.
The scripts are very easy to use and have some useful features even if you don't
use the same workflow as iFixit.
